						>Additional Disclosures for Data Subjects in the European Economic
						Area, the United Kingdom and Cayman Islands</b
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					The following provisions apply only to residents of EEA, UK, and
					Cayman Islands.
				</p>
				<p><b>Roles</b></p>
				<p>
					The General Data Protection Regulations in the European Economic Area
					and the United Kingdom ("GDPR") and the Data Protection Act ("DPA") of
					Cayman Islands distinguish between organizations that process personal
					data for their own purposes (known as "controllers") and organizations
					that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as
					"processors"). We act as a controller with respect to personal data
					collected as you interact with the Site.
				</p>
				<p><b>Lawful Basis for Processing</b></p>
				<p>
					The GDPR and DPA require a "lawful basis" for processing personal
					data. Our lawful bases include where: (i) you have given consent to
					the processing for one or more specific purposes, either to our
					service providers or partners or to us; (ii) processing is necessary
					for the performance of a contract with you; (iii) processing is
					necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (iv) processing
					is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by
					us or a third party, and your interests and fundamental rights and
					freedoms do not override those interests. Where applicable, we will
					transfer your personal data to third parties subject to appropriate or
					suitable safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses.
				</p>
				<p><b>Your Data Subject Rights</b></p>
				<p>
					If you are a user in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom,
					or Cayman Islands, you maintain certain rights under the GDPR or DPA,
					as applicable. These rights include but are not limited to the right
					to (i) request access and obtain a copy of your personal data; (ii)
					request rectification or erasure of your personal data; (iii) object
					to or restrict the processing of your personal data; and (iv) request
					portability of your personal data. Additionally, if we have collected
					and processed your personal data with your consent, you have the right
					to withdraw your consent at any time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Notwithstanding the foregoing, we cannot edit or delete information
					that is stored on a particular blockchain as we do not have custody or
					control over any blockchains. This information includes all
					transaction data related to your interaction with OpenAgent on the
					blockchain.
				</p>
				<p>
					To exercise any of these rights, please contact us via the email
					listed in the "How to Contact Us" section above and specify which
					right you are seeking to exercise. We will respond to your request
					within thirty (30) days. We may require specific information from you
					to help us confirm your identity and process your request. Please note
					that we retain information as necessary to fulfill the purpose for
					which it was collected and may continue to retain and use information
					even after a data subject request in accordance with our legitimate
					interests, including as necessary to comply with our legal
					obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our
					agreements.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you have any issues with our compliance, please contact us as set
					out in the "How to Contact Us" section above. You also reserve the
					right to lodge a complaint with the data protection regulator in your
					jurisdiction.
